# Documentation

This folder compiles the key deliverables and supporting materials developed for the **Systems Analysis & Design Project — Kaggle Titanic Case Study**.  
Each document presents a specific stage of the project, from the technical foundation to the final communication artifacts.
Serves as a centralized repository for all academic deliverables, ensuring transparency, traceability, and reproducibility of the project results.  
Together, these documents reflect both the **engineering analysis** and **applied data science** components of the Titanic survival prediction system.
