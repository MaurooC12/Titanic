# Titanic: Machine learning from disaster
This repository explores the Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster competition through a systems analysis lens. Instead of focusing only on prediction, the project examines how passenger data, model behavior, and uncertainty interact as parts of a complex system. Key elements like feature relationships, missing data, and randomness are analyzed to understand not just what the model predicts—but why.
