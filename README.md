# System Analysis & Design Project — Kaggle Titanic Case Study

---

## Overview

This repository contains the academic development of two workshops from the *Systems Analysis & Design* course at Universidad Distrital Francisco José de Caldas.  
The case study is based on the Kaggle competition **“Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster”**, applying systems thinking and engineering design principles to analyze, model, and structure a predictive system for passenger survival.

## Workshop 1 — Systems Engineering Analysis

This first stage focuses on the **systemic understanding** of the Titanic competition.  
It identifies key elements, relationships, and constraints, while analyzing **sensitivity, complexity, and chaotic behavior** within the data.  
The workshop establishes the conceptual foundation for the system’s structure, exploring how small variations in input can affect global performance.

## Workshop 2 — System Design and Requirements

Building upon the analytical results from Workshop 1, this phase translates insights into a **system architecture and formal design specification**.  
It defines **functional, non-functional, sensitivity-driven, and user-centric requirements**, ensuring the system is modular, scalable, and reproducible.  
The resulting document represents the engineered blueprint of the predictive workflow.

## Documentation

The Documentation folder contains complementary materials that support the system design and analysis process.  
It includes detailed technical reports, diagrams, datasets references, and visual documentation related to both workshops and the general system architecture.  
This section serves as a centralized space for project artifacts and supporting evidence used in the academic development of the Kaggle Titanic case study.
