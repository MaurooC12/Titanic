# Workshop 1 - Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster

## 📌 Overview
This project is it focuses on the Kaggle competition **“Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster”**, which challenges participants to predict passenger survival using machine learning techniques.

The study is not only technical but also analytical: we explore the **systemic relationships** among variables (sex, age, class, fare, etc.), their impact on survival, and the inherent **complexity, chaos, and randomness** present in real-world events.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Build a predictive model to classify whether a passenger survived (1) or not (0).
- Understand the systemic nature of the Titanic dataset: variables, dependencies, constraints, and external factors.
- Manage **missing data**, **class imbalance**, and **nonlinear relationships**.
- Highlight how chaos and uncertainty play a role in survival, beyond pure data analysis.
