# Workshop 2 â€” System Design and Requirements

---

## Overview

This workshop represents the **second stage** of the *System Analysis & Design Project*.  
It builds upon the findings from **Workshop 1**, transforming the systemic understanding of the Titanic competition  
into a structured **system design**.  
The goal is to define the **functional**, **non-functional**, and **sensitivity-driven** requirements that ensure  
a modular, reproducible, and reliable predictive workflow aligned with systems engineering principles.

This phase marks the transition from analysis to design, focusing on the architecture, behavior, and robustness of the system.

## Objectives

- Translate analytical insights from Workshop 1 into clear, measurable **system requirements**.  
- Develop a **high-level system architecture** that defines the interaction among modules (data ingestion, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation).  
- Integrate **systems engineering principles** such as modularity, scalability, and maintainability.  
- Incorporate mechanisms to address **chaos and sensitivity**, reducing unpredictability in model behavior.  
- Produce a **formal design document** that serves as the technical foundation for future implementation.
