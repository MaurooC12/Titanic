# Workshop 2 – Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster

## 📌 Overview
This repository corresponds to **Workshop 2** of the *Systems Analysis & Design* course.  
It builds upon the analytical foundations established in **Workshop 1**, where a systemic analysis of the Kaggle competition *“Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster”* was conducted.  

In this stage, the focus shifts from analysis to **system design** — defining requirements, architecture, and engineering principles for a predictive model capable of estimating passenger survival based on multiple features.  
The design emphasizes **modularity, scalability, and resilience**, considering the effects of **chaos and sensitivity** identified in the first workshop.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Define the **system requirements** (functional, non-functional, and sensitivity-driven) based on the previous analysis.  
- Propose a **high-level architecture** for data ingestion, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.  
- Integrate **systems engineering principles** to ensure maintainability, reproducibility, and performance.  
- Address chaotic or unpredictable behaviors in data through controlled randomness and monitoring mechanisms.  
- Document the complete design process, including diagrams, interface definitions, and justification of design decisions.

## 🧩 Project Scope
The design targets the **Titanic Kaggle competition**, which challenges participants to predict passenger survival (1 = survived, 0 = not survived) using data such as gender, age, class, fare, and embarkation port.  
The solution is implemented in Python using **Kaggle Notebooks**, and follows a structured pipeline that ensures reliability, interpretability, and performance.
