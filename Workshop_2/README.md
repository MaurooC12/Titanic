# Workshop 2 — Systems Design and Implementation

---

## Overview

This workshop represents the **second stage** of the *System Analysis & Design Project*.  
Building upon the analytical foundation established in Workshop 1, it focuses on developing a **system design** for the Kaggle competition  
**“Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster.”**

The goal is to translate the analytical findings — including sensitivity, chaos, and systemic dependencies — into a **robust, modular, and reproducible system architecture** capable of handling real-world data challenges.

## Objectives

- Design a **comprehensive system architecture** that connects data ingestion, preprocessing, model training, and deployment.  
- Integrate **systems engineering principles** such as scalability, modularity, and maintainability.  
- Address **chaotic and sensitive behaviors** through controlled randomness, monitoring, and feedback mechanisms.  
- Define a **technical stack** aligned with the analytical needs of the project.  
- Produce a structured **System Design Document** that serves as a blueprint for future implementations.

## Key Design Features

The system design emphasizes **clarity, modularity, and control**.  
Each stage of the workflow — from data loading to prediction generation — is clearly separated to ensure maintainability and reproducibility.  

Core characteristics include:  
- **Python-based stack** using Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Flask, and Docker.  
- **Pipeline architecture** that supports step-by-step execution and testing.  
- **Cross-validation** to enhance model robustness and reliability.  
- **Logging and monitoring** to identify sensitivity and chaos within data behavior.  
- **Containerized deployment** for scalable and reproducible execution environments.
