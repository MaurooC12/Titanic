\section*{1. Review of Workshop \#1 Findings}

The analytical work from Workshop \#1 provided a comprehensive understanding of the Titanic competition as a dynamic and interdependent system. Rather than treating it as a simple prediction problem, the study highlighted structural dependencies, sensitivity points, and chaotic behaviors that influence model performance and reliability.

\subsection*{System Overview and Core Elements}

The system’s main objective is to predict passenger survival using multiple features — such as class, sex, age, and family relations — extracted from \texttt{train.csv}, \texttt{test.csv}, and \texttt{gender\_submission.csv}. Each dataset interacts with the others through defined roles in the machine learning pipeline: data ingestion, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation within Kaggle’s controlled environment.

\subsection*{Data Characteristics and Constraints}

Several structural constraints were identified in the datasets:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Missing or incomplete values in \texttt{Age}, \texttt{Cabin}, and \texttt{Embarked}
    \item Class imbalance biasing model learning
    \item Limited dataset size (approximately 1,300 samples), increasing risk of overfitting
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Sensitivity and Complexity}

The system displays high sensitivity to key predictors (\texttt{Sex}, \texttt{Pclass}, \texttt{Age}). Removing or misprocessing them decreases accuracy. Nonlinear relationships such as \texttt{Sex} $\times$ \texttt{Age} and \texttt{Pclass} $\times$ \texttt{Fare} create complex interactions requiring feature engineering and regularization.

\subsection*{Chaos and Randomness}

Even structured datasets like Titanic’s contain unpredictability. Passengers with similar profiles sometimes had opposite outcomes due to hidden variables. Family-related variables (\texttt{SibSp}, \texttt{Parch}) introduce feedback loops, reflecting emergent nonlinear behavior—an echo of chaos theory in data.

\subsection*{Implications for System Design}

These findings guide the system design foundations: modularity, robustness, and controlled randomness. Each stage—from data ingestion to model evaluation—must minimize instability and maximize reproducibility.

\subsection*{Functional Requirements}

\begin{table}[H]

\begin{tabular}{|p{1cm}|p{4cm}|p{9cm}|}
\hline
\textbf{ID} & \textbf{Requirement} & \textbf{Description} \\ \hline
FR-1 & Data Ingestion Module & Load and validate input datasets (\texttt{train.csv}, \texttt{test.csv}, and \texttt{gender\_submission.csv}). \\ \hline
FR-2 & Preprocessing and Cleaning & Handle missing or null values in variables such as \texttt{Age}, \texttt{Cabin}, and \texttt{Embarked}. \\ \hline
FR-3 & Feature Engineering & Apply transformations (e.g., one-hot encoding for categorical variables). \\ \hline
FR-4 & Model Training & Train a supervised learning model (e.g., Random Forest) to predict \texttt{Survived}. \\ \hline
FR-5 & Evaluation and Metrics & Compute model accuracy and generate submission file. \\ \hline
FR-6 & Submission Output & Export predictions to \texttt{submission.csv} following Kaggle’s structure. \\ \hline
\end{tabular}

\end{table}

\subsection*{Non-Functional Requirements}

\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{|p{1cm}|p{4cm}|p{9cm}|}
\hline
\textbf{ID} & \textbf{Requirement} & \textbf{Description} \\ \hline
NFR-1 & Performance & Process datasets (1,300 records) in less than 5 seconds. \\ \hline
NFR-2 & Scalability & Allow easy addition of features without refactoring. \\ \hline
NFR-3 & Reproducibility & Use fixed random seeds and documented dependencies. \\ \hline
NFR-4 & Maintainability & Modular architecture separating stages. \\ \hline
NFR-5 & Usability & Provide clear workflow and outputs. \\ \hline
NFR-6 & Reliability & Handle corrupted input files gracefully. \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{Non-Functional Requirements}
\end{table}

\subsection*{Sensitivity-Driven Requirements}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{SR-1 – Controlled Randomness:} Use fixed random seeds in training.
    \item \textbf{SR-2 – Robust Feature Selection:} Include key predictors (\texttt{Sex}, \texttt{Pclass}, \texttt{Age}).
    \item \textbf{SR-3 – Missing Data Resilience:} Apply imputation strategies.
    \item \textbf{SR-4 – Monitoring and Feedback:} Log performance metrics to detect anomalies.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{User-Centric Requirements}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{UR-1 – Simplicity:} Execute workflow in one notebook sequence.
    \item \textbf{UR-2 – Interpretability:} Provide explainable feature relationships.
    \item \textbf{UR-3 – Security:} Prevent exposure of private Kaggle data.
\end{itemize}

\noindent
These requirements translate the \textit{Workshop 1} insights into engineering goals that ensure an \textbf{accurate, reproducible, and resilient} predictive system.

\noindent
\textbf{Figure \ref{fig:system-architecture}} illustrates the architecture of the Kaggle competition environment. Competitors access the competition page, download datasets, train models in notebooks, and submit predictions for evaluation. The system computes accuracy, updates leaderboards, and integrates community interaction via forums and repositories.
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{User:} The user will be an ordinary person regardless of their occupation; in reality, they only need to have an interest in the world of systems analysis, with access to practically the entire system except for certain interactions that will be carried out internally by the system.
    \item \textbf{Interface \& competition page:} This module allows the user to interact directly with the competency environment, meaning that they are allowed to access the competency and view all the necessary information to understand the environment. Additionally, there are community environments that allow users to ask questions about the competencies.
    \item \textbf{Data \& Notebooks/Compute:} This module allows the user to dive into the competition, accessing the data that will be used, the testing environment, and resources such as the notebooks provided by Kaggle for a better understanding of the competition.
    \item \textbf{Storage/DB:} Prevent exposure of private Kaggle data
    \item \textbf{Submissions, Evolution \& Leaderboard:} Prevent exposure of private Kaggle data
\end{itemize}
